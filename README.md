# SVM Image Classification of Cats and Dogs
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The code uses a subset of the dataset to reduce time complexity and make the training process faster.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and consists of two folders: `Train` and `Test`, each containing subfolders `cats` and `dogs` with corresponding images. The dataset should be downloaded and extracted before running the code.
